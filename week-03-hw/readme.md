Just like last week, you are expected to write a well-formed readme.md file that is a technical report about your work this week. Remember to use markdown syntax to style and add structure to your document. This file should include information about what it is you did and learned this week, as well as information about trials/triumphs, additional sources your sought out, and how this week will change your work going forward.

<h2>Week 3 readme file </h2>
<hr />
<p>This week I continued to learn about markdown and became much more familar with the software being used for this class.  I created my first HTML doccument using Atom, and made a few additions and adjustments to it after putting it onto Github.</br>
Last week I was feeling very overwhelmed and frusturated, but after gaining more experience this week I now feel much more comfortable using Github, Atom and Powershell. It was very satisfing when things began to work more smoothly for me.</br>
I did hae a slight problem this week with fixing a typo in my repo title, and I posted on the forum asking for help.  Immediately after posting this, I figured the painfully obvious solution out for myself and posted the solution to my issue, but a classmate did offer help which I really appreciated. </p>
