<h1> Laura Sugiyama section 50 </h1>
<h2>Week 3 readme file </h2>
<hr />
This week I continued to learn about markdown and became much more familar with the software being used for this class.  I created my first HTML doccument using Atom, and made a few additions and adjustments to it after putting it onto Github.</br>

Last week I was feeling very overwhelmed and frusturated, but after gaining more experience this week I now feel much more comfortable using Github, Atom and Powershell. It was very satisfing when things began to work more smoothly for me.</br>

I did hae a slight problem this week with fixing a typo in my repo title, and I posted on the forum asking for help.  Immediately after posting this, I figured the painfully obvious solution out for myself and posted the solution to my issue, but a classmate did offer help which I really appreciated.
